Hello!

I’m **Yutong (Felicia) Wang**, a PhD student in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics at the **Phonetics and Phonology Lab, University of Cambridge**. My research investigates how morphophonological processes shape phonetic realisations in Beijing Mandarin, with interests in:

- Acoustic phonetics
- Rime merger and retroflex suffixation
- Incomplete contrast neutralisation
- The phonetics–phonology interface
- Feline acoustics

## Academic Background

- **PhD student in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics**, Jesus College, University of Cambridge (expected 2027)
  <br>– Supervised by Prof Brechtje Post and Dr Mitko Sabev (Saarland)
- **MPhil in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics (Distinction)**, Darwin College, University of Cambridge (2022)  
  – Dissertation: *On the Nature of Beijing Retroflex Suffixation: An Acoustic Study*, supervised by Dr Mitko Sabev 
- **BA in Linguistics (First Class Honours)**, University of Manchester (2021)  
  – Dissertation: *Cues in Mandarin Tone Perception by Human Listeners and Automatic Recognisers*, supervised by Dr Wendell Kimper

## Current Research

My work explores how segmental rime merger in Beijing Mandarin interacts with tonal processes under retroflex suffixation. Using acoustic and statistical methods, I analyse:

- Spectral and temporal aspects of rime changes
- Tonal shifts under morphological conditioning
- Perceptual correlates of incomplete neutralisation

## Teaching

I supervise undergraduate papers:

- Li1 (Sounds and Words) – 2024, 2025  
- Li6 (Phonetics) – 2025  

Previously, I also tutored for:

- Jesus College Winter Programme - 2024, 2025

Topics I’ve taught include:

## Beyond the Lab

- Editor, *Cambridge Occasional Papers in Linguistics* - 2025, 2026  
- Seminar Coordinator, Phonetics & Phonology Seminar Series - 2024  
- Faculty/University Open Day Lab Demonstrator - 2024, 2025

Outside academia, I enjoy running, good coffee, mixology, and support from my fluffy research assistants. Cho-Mee's one of them.
